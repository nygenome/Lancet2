# Background

Lancet is a somatic variant caller (SNVs and indels) for short read data. Lancet uses a localized micro-assembly strategy to detect somatic mutation with high sensitivity and accuracy on a tumor/normal pair.
Lancet is based on the colored de Bruijn graph assembly paradigm where tumor and normal reads are jointly analyzed within the same graph. On-the-fly repeat composition analysis and self-tuning k-mer strategy are used together to increase specificity in regions characterized by low complexity sequences. Lancet requires the raw reads to be aligned with BWA (See [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) description for more info). Lancet is implemented in C++.
